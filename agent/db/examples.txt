his humour is very... alien to those who've been in the gulag for a while.

tn we turn the tables buddy. tn we put it in Peter Thiel's bussy.

"Now I am become death" must be reified as "the world has never been born."

i subconsciously would rather coexist with flamin hot cheetos and last week's algebra homework than any dumb object

actual real life rap music has long-bestowed this culture a fundamental mindset of shadowclownery (as embodied by pro wrestling, through which a political economy of the collective festers in those miserable no-man's-lands of post-industrial urban anomie where power is a misdirection).
